# FigmaReactHackathon
FigmaReact Workshop from CMF 2022 Hackathon

To run and see my figma cards:

1. For Windows 10: [follow this tutorial](https://dev.to/skaytech/how-to-install-node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows-10-4nbi) and download NVM for Windows.
   * Notes: If running `nvm use {version number}` gives you something like `Exit Status 5: Access denied`, open `cmd` or `powershell` as administrator and run `nvm install latest` and subsequent commands there

2. Clone this repository into VS Code or desired IDE/folder.

3. Open terminal and navigate to the figma-to-react folder using `cd figma-to-react`

4. Run `npm install`

5. Run `npm start` to start the application. A web browser should open up and you should be able to see my cards.


The orginal folder was cloned [here](https://github.com/christylo/figma-to-react-workshop). The Figma React Workshop focused on creating a card in React. I went a little further by adding another card and making more props for easier customization.
